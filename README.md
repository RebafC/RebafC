- 👋 Hi, I’m @RebafC (aka Chris)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding standards particularly around PHP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about TDD (using some of Uncle Bob's Katas), OO generally and as much git as I can
- 🤔 I have some familiarity with many computer languages from the ancient (RPG & Cobol) to more modern (PHP) and several in between (VB),
as well as some web specifics (HTML & CSS). 
- 🏫 Perhaps next computer language might be one of the functional langauges
- 💻 I use Windows and VSCode on an ancient laptop
- ✨ I can find my around Wordpress plugins
- 😵‍💫 Don't ask me for graphic design ... I'm not the one you're looking for
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm open to ideas
- 👪 🎸⚾ are some of my interests away from technology
- 🇦🇺 I'm based in Australia

It might look like I have lots of repositories but only one is my own work. I have raised issues on a small number. But I grow more adventurous all the time.

I hope it's OK. The icons I added are from [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/).
